Step by Step guide to install Ruby & Rails on Unix
===

This project is a guide through Ruby/Rails instalation for Rails newcomers. I'll try to update the guides as soon as new versions of Ubuntu and MacOS are released to make sure all steps continue to work. Any contribution is very welcome via pull requests.

There's also an option to use a Virtual Machine for your projects, you can follow the steps for that here: https://github.com/rails/rails-dev-box
